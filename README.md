This is an innovative AI-powered web application designed to provide personalized and accessible speech therapy for individuals who stutter. It leverages cutting-edge technologies like natural language processing (NLP), machine learning (ML), and speech recognition to offer a comprehensive suite of tools and resources for improving fluency and communication skills.

## Key Features

* **Real-time Speech Analysis:** Provides real-time feedback on speech patterns, including fluency, speaking rate, articulation, and voice quality.
* **AI Speech Coach:** Offers interactive conversations with an AI-powered speech coach for practicing various communication scenarios.
* **Fluency Shaping Exercises:** Guides users through evidence-based fluency shaping techniques with personalized feedback and progress tracking.
* **Educational Resources:** Provides access to a library of articles, videos, and interactive exercises on stuttering and fluency management.
* **Personalized Progress Tracking:** Tracks fluency scores, achievements, and personalized insights to monitor progress and set goals.
* **Gamified Learning:** Incorporates gamification elements like badges and rewards to enhance motivation and engagement.
* **Secure and Private:** Ensures user data privacy and security with robust authentication and encryption measures.

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend:** React, Redux, Material-UI, Web Speech API, TensorFlow.js
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express, GraphQL, Apollo Server, MongoDB, Redis
* **AI/ML:** Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Transformers, Librosa, Kaldi
* **DevOps:** Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (S3, EC2, Lambda, CloudFront), CI/CD (Travis CI, GitHub Actions)

## Architecture

The StutterOn platform follows a microservices architecture, with separate services for user management, speech analysis, AI model training, and data storage. This allows for scalability, maintainability, and independent deployment of different components.

* **Client Application:** A React-based single-page application (SPA) that interacts with the backend API and provides the user interface.
* **API Gateway:** An Express.js server that acts as an API gateway, routing requests to different microservices.
* **User Service:** Manages user authentication, authorization, and profile information.
* **Speech Analysis Service:** Performs real-time speech analysis using NLP and ML models.
* **AI Model Training Service:** Trains and deploys AI models for speech recognition, fluency prediction, and other tasks.
* **Data Storage:** Uses MongoDB for storing user data, session data, and progress information. Redis is used for caching and queuing tasks.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/your-username/stutteron.git`
2. **Install dependencies:**
   - **Client:** `npm install --prefix client`
   - **Server:** `npm install --prefix server`
3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create `.env` files in both `client` and `server` directories.
   - Set the required environment variables (see `.env.example` files for reference).
4. **Start the development servers:**
   - **Client:** `npm start --prefix client`
   - **Server:** `npm start --prefix server`

## Running Tests

* **Client:** `npm test --prefix client`
* **Server:** `npm test --prefix server`

## Deployment

The deployment process is automated using a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Travis CI, GitHub Actions). The pipeline builds the application, runs tests, and deploys the code to the production environment (e.g., AWS).

* **Client:** Deployed to an S3 bucket and served via CloudFront.
* **Server:** Deployed to EC2 instances or containerized using Docker and Kubernetes.
