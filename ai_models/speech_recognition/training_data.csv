# This is a simplified representation of how the training_data.csv might look

# It's crucial to understand that this is NOT actual code, but a representation of data
# The actual CSV would contain thousands or millions of rows with acoustic features

# Columns:
#   - timestamp: Timestamp of the audio frame
#   - f0: Fundamental frequency (pitch)
#   - f1, f2, f3: Formant frequencies
#   - intensity: Intensity of the speech signal
#   - jitter: Jitter (pitch perturbation)
#   - shimmer: Shimmer (amplitude perturbation)
#   - hnr: Harmonics-to-noise ratio
#   - mfcc1, mfcc2, ..., mfcc13: Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients
#   - fluency: Binary label (1 for fluent, 0 for disfluent)

# This pattern would continue for millions of rows, capturing various speech patterns
# with corresponding acoustic features and fluency labels.

# Important considerations:

# - Data volume: A large and diverse dataset is crucial for training a robust model.
# - Data quality: The accuracy and consistency of the labels are essential.
# - Feature engineering: Selecting and extracting relevant acoustic features is critical.
# - Data augmentation: Techniques like adding noise or changing pitch can improve model generalization.
# - Data balancing: Ensure a balanced representation of fluent and disfluent speech.
